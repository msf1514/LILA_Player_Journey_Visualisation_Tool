# Workflow Pattern Analyzer

A web-compatible Custom Skill that brings export-quality conversation analysis to Claude's web interface. Analyzes recent conversation history using native chat tools to identify recurring patterns and generate evidence-based Custom Skills recommendations.

## Why This Skill?

**The Bridge Between Two Worlds:**
- **Export-based plugin** (`/analyze-skills`): Comprehensive but requires Claude Code + JSON exports
- **skill-idea-generator**: Web-friendly but lacks statistical rigor
- **workflow-pattern-analyzer**: Best of both - rigorous analysis accessible anywhere

## Key Features

### 🌐 Web Interface Compatible
- No conversation exports required
- Uses `recent_chats` and `conversation_search` tools
- Works in Claude.ai web interface or Claude Code

### 📊 Statistical Rigor
- **5-dimensional scoring framework** (0-10 scale each):
  - Frequency analysis
  - Consistency evaluation
  - Complexity assessment
  - Time savings calculation
  - Error reduction potential
- **Composite scoring** (0-50 total) for prioritization
- **Statistical validation** with significance thresholds

### 🎯 Comprehensive Analysis
- Pattern discovery across multiple dimensions (explicit, implicit, domain, temporal)
- Relationship mapping and overlap detection
- Smart consolidation strategies
- Evidence-based recommendations with conversation excerpts

### 📦 Complete Outputs
- Detailed analysis reports with pattern evidence
- Prioritization matrix (frequency vs impact)
- Ready-to-use skill specifications
- Implementation roadmap

## When to Use

**Perfect for:**
- Web interface users who can't run `/analyze-skills`
- Quick pattern identification without export overhead
- Iterative skill discovery (start small, expand as needed)
- Users who want analysis rigor without technical setup

**Use the export plugin instead when:**
- You have Claude/ChatGPT conversation exports available
- You need cross-platform analysis (Claude + ChatGPT)
- You want comprehensive historical analysis (100+ conversations)
- You need incremental processing for large datasets

## Usage Guide

### Quick Start

Simply say:
- "Analyze my conversation patterns"
- "What workflows should I automate?"
- "Find skill opportunities in my recent chats"
- "Identify my most common requests"

### Analysis Depth Options

**1. Quick Scan (20-30 conversations, ~2-3 min)**
```
"Do a quick scan of my recent conversations"
```
Best for: Immediate insights, identifying top 1-2 patterns

**2. Standard Analysis (50-75 conversations, ~5-7 min)**
```
"Analyze my conversation history for patterns"
```
Best for: Comprehensive pattern detection, multiple skill opportunities

**3. Deep Dive (100+ conversations, ~10-15 min)**
```
"Do a comprehensive analysis of my workflows"
```
Best for: Full workflow mapping, temporal trends, strategic insights

**4. Targeted Search (variable)**
```
"Find patterns in my coding conversations"
"Analyze how I use you for writing tasks"
```
Best for: Domain-specific skill discovery

### Understanding the Output

**Score Interpretation:**
- **40-50 (Critical)**: Implement immediately - highest ROI
- **30-39 (High)**: Strong candidates for skill creation
- **20-29 (Medium)**: Consider for automation
- **10-19 (Low)**: Defer or use simple prompt templates
- **0-9 (Not Viable)**: Not worth skill automation

**Prioritization Matrix:**
```
VALUE/IMPACT
     │
HIGH │  Quick Wins      Strategic
     │  [Immediate ROI]  [Critical but complex]
     │
LOW  │  Automate        Defer
     │  [Nice-to-have]  [Not worth it]
     │
     └─────────────────────────
          LOW  FREQUENCY  HIGH
```

## Advanced Usage

### Incremental Analysis
Start with quick scan, expand iteratively:
```
1. Quick scan (30 conversations) → Identify top pattern
2. Generate skill for top pattern → Deploy and test
3. Standard analysis (50-75 conversations) → Find next opportunities
4. Deep dive (100+ conversations) → Complete workflow mapping
```

### Adjusting Scoring Weights
Request custom prioritization:
```
"Analyze my patterns but prioritize time savings over frequency"
"Focus on high-complexity patterns even if they're less frequent"
```

### Domain-Focused Batches
Analyze specific workflow areas:
```
"Analyze my business communication patterns"
"Find patterns in my technical writing"
"What do I repeatedly do for project planning?"
```

## Technical Details

### Data Collection Strategy
- **Broad sampling**: Multiple `recent_chats` calls with varied parameters
- **Temporal distribution**: Sample across different time periods
- **Topic exploration**: `conversation_search` for discovered domains
- **Smart batching**: Balance coverage with efficiency

### Pattern Detection Methods
- **Explicit markers**: Repeated phrases, formatting instructions
- **Implicit workflows**: Multi-turn structures, refinement cycles
- **Domain clustering**: Topic frequency and task type analysis
- **Temporal patterns**: Recurring tasks, event-driven workflows

### Scoring Methodology
Each pattern scored 0-10 across 5 dimensions:
1. **Frequency**: Occurrence rate in conversation sample
2. **Consistency**: Similarity of requirements across instances
3. **Complexity**: Steps, decision points, cognitive load
4. **Time Savings**: Minutes saved per use × frequency
5. **Error Reduction**: Quality improvement potential

Composite score (0-50) determines priority classification.

## Limitations

**Compared to Export-Based Analysis:**
- ❌ Can't analyze ChatGPT conversations
- ❌ Limited to accessible recent history (API constraints)
- ❌ No cross-platform deduplication
- ❌ Can't process 1000+ conversation datasets efficiently
- ❌ No incremental processing log

**Inherent Constraints:**
- Requires 10+ conversations for basic analysis
- Pattern detection accuracy improves with more data
- Very old conversations may not be accessible via tools
- Analysis time scales with conversation depth

## Best Practices

**For Accurate Results:**
1. Run analysis after accumulating 30+ conversations
2. Use targeted searches for specific domains
3. Request deep dive for comprehensive insights
4. Provide feedback on detected patterns (accuracy validation)

**For Skill Generation:**
1. Start with top 3-5 highest-scoring patterns
2. Test generated skills before building more
3. Iterate based on actual usage
4. Re-run analysis monthly as patterns evolve

**For Efficiency:**
1. Use quick scans for regular check-ins
2. Save deep dive for quarterly workflow audits
3. Focus targeted searches on specific pain points
4. Combine analysis with skill building in same session
